# Hook Everything (v5.1)

Architect invisible psychological pull, live market relevance, deep credibility, and natural human prose across marketing, writing, and product projects in any language.

## When to Use

Use this suite when researching live market trends and Voice-of-Customer (VoC) language via `skills/market-intelligence` (while filtering out forced trend-jacking), calibrating tone and proof density to specific audiences via `skills/audience-calibration`, or brainstorming non-cliche hook concepts via `skills/creative-ideation`. It also governs layering 3-4 mechanisms simultaneously via `skills/hook-compounding`, designing zero-scam marketing campaigns (`skills/marketing-hooks`), structuring spatial layouts (`skills/visual-ux-hooks`), building product flows (`skills/product-hooks`), writing long-form pieces (`skills/writing-hooks`), and auditing text in any language so it passes all 85 rules in `skills/anti-slop` and scores `<= 15/100` on `tools/slop_scan.py`.

## The 7-Stage Execution Pipeline

1. **Scan Live Market & Filter for Organic Fit (`skills/market-intelligence/SKILL.md`)**
   Query live market signals and 2-to-4 star user reviews. Apply the **Organic Fit Gate** so a market trend is woven in only if it causally impacts the user's problem.
2. **Calibrate to Audience & Channel (`skills/audience-calibration/SKILL.md`)**
   Check whether the audience is in Central Route (high scrutiny, low construal) or Peripheral Route (fast-scrolling, low ability) processing, then set register and evidence density.
3. **Ideate via Bisociation (`skills/creative-ideation/SKILL.md`)**
   Discard the first 3 default LLM ideas (`First-3 Graveyard`) and collide real user friction with 6 structural lenses.
4. **Establish Trust & Compose Hook Chords (`skills/trust-architecture/SKILL.md` + `skills/hook-compounding/SKILL.md`)**
   Combine `Trust Damper + Cognitive Anchor + Active Generator + Forward Vector` and rotate chords horizontally.
5. **Apply Spatial & Perceptual Structure (`skills/visual-ux-hooks/SKILL.md`)**
   Structure visual isolation (Von Restorff), choice caps (Iyengar & Lepper), skimmer eye-brakes, and response timing.
6. **Execute Domain Playbook (`marketing-hooks`, `writing-hooks`, or `product-hooks`)**
   Draft the deliverables with micro-commitment ladders, regret elimination, and earned payoffs.
7. **Enforce 85-Rule Anti-Slop & 12-Point Value Gate (`anti-slop` + `value-check`)**
   Run `python3 tools/slop_scan.py <file> --fix-hints` (target `<= 15/100`) and verify all 12 checks in `value-check`.
